Car Rental System
This is a C program that simulates a car rental system. 
The program defines several structures for storing car rental data, including car information, customer information, and rental date information. 
The program also defines an enumeration type for representing user roles and two functions for adding new cars to the rental system and listing all available cars.
The code defines several data structures using the struct keyword. 
The data structures are used to store the information about the cars in the system, the rental date, the return date, and the customer's information.
The main data structure used in the code is aracBilgileri, which stores the information about each car in the system, such as the car ID, brand, model, rental price, rental status, rental date, return date, and customer's information.
The code also defines two other data structures, musteriBilgileri and tarihBilgileri, which store the customer's information and the date information, respectively.
The aracListesi structure is used to store an array of aracBilgileri structures, representing the list of cars in the system.
The code defines several functions for the car rental system, including yeniAracEkle, which allows the user to add a new car to the system, and aracListele, which lists all the cars in the system.
The main function of the code uses a switch statement to display a menu to the user, allowing them to choose from various options, such as adding a new car, renting a car, and returning a car.
